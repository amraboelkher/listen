# Listen

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/cschiewek/listen/branches/master/shields_badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/cschiewek/listen)

Listen provides an API endpoint to which you can send audio (URL or file), which it then broadcasts over a websocket.  That's it.

Demo: http://listen.schiewek.com

To start locally app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
